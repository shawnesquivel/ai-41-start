When crafting a LinkedIn post, please follow these guidelines:

# Content Guidelines

- Introduce Matchya as an AI-driven platform that connects users with therapists
- Use a problem-to-solution framing: start by briefly describing the problem users face (e.g., confusing directories, overwhelming profiles) and then explain how the updated chatbot addresses these issues
- Clearly mention "Matchya" to avoid confusing readers who might be unfamiliar with the platform
- Describe the update in plain, factual language without using marketing buzzwords (avoid words like "discover," "empower," etc.)
- Keep the tone straightforward, conversational, and focused on the functionality and benefits of the update
- Include a clear call to action

# Post Structure

1. Headline: Brief and descriptive, avoid clickbait
2. Introduction: 1-2 sentences explaining what Matchya is and the update
3. Key Points: 2-3 bullet points highlighting main improvements
4. Call-to-action: Simple link to try the platform

# Formatting

- Use minimal emojis (üçµ for Matchya branding if needed)
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Use bullet points for key features
- Include relevant links and screenshots if available

# Tone

- Professional but conversational
- Focus on user benefits rather than technical details
- Avoid marketing jargon and buzzwords
- Write as a friendly product update, not a sales pitch
