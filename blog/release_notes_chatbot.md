Matchya Chatbot: Enhanced Therapist Matching Workflow  
Type: New Release  
Categories: Feature

Summary:  
We've updated Matchya's therapist matching workflow to better capture your therapy preferences and provide more accurate matches.

We talked to therapists to understand how they typically match a client to therapy styles and approaches. By using a simple questionnaire and a free-from chat input, you can quickly refine what kind of therapy and therapists are recommended to you.

We've also improved matchya's âœ¨ friendliness âœ¨ index to better address inquiries about specific therapist profiles, insurance details, and general therapy deep-dives.

Key Features & Changes:

- **Structured Questionnaire Integration**:  
  Users complete a six-part questionnaire capturing key therapy preferences (e.g., reason, frequency, style, session type). For example, if you mention that you're only looking for 1-2 sessions, therapy approaches with longer term outcomes like DBT wouldn't be recommended to you. These subtleties help you narrow down the therapy approach that's right for you.

- **Mention Preferences in Natural Language**:  
  Merged preferences with additional free-form input provided later in the chat. Whatever you say is 100% confidential â€“ the more specific you are, the better we can match you with a relevant therapist.

- **Improved Friendlinessâœ¨**:  
  We want matchya to be your friend that happens to work as a receptionist at a therapy clinic. We've made key upgrades to how matchya follows up with you, to minimize friction:

  - ðŸ’¬ _Chat with Profiles_: Any preferences mentioned will be matched directly to relevant experiences or certifications in recommended therapists' profiles.

  - ðŸ™‹ _Insurance Coverage_: At any point, you can ask questions about insurance coverage questions.

  - ðŸ˜Œ _Therapist Jargon_: CBT, DBT, wtf? We're tired of therapy jargon too. Matchya simplifies therapy speech, so you can learn more about what you need.
