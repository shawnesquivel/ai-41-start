**Find and book your ideal therapist with AI.**

## What is Matchya?

Matchya is an AI-powered receptionist that instantly connects you with your ideal therapist through a simple, chat-based interface. Our goal is to replace clunky directories and frustrating searches with a conversational solution that delivers the right therapist for you.

---

## The Problem

Finding a therapist today can be a frustrating and emotional ordeal. Users face:

- Endless, jargon-filled profiles
- Uncertain insurance details
- Tedious phone calls

This often leads to discouragement after a single bad session. Meanwhile, therapists struggle to stand out among outdated directories, making it hard for them to attract quality leads.

Online therapy platforms like BetterHelp, directories like PsychologyToday, as well as traditional referral-based services. While these platforms provide access to therapy, they often come with overwhelming UIs and generic matching algorithms that leave users frustrated.

## Our Solution

Matchya replaces clunky directories with a conversational, AI-driven interface. Key elements include:

- **Chat in Natural Language**: Understands your preferences in natural language
- **Multi Language Support**: Supports any language, perfect for non-native speakers
