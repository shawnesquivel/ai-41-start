Hey there!

[HOOK + PERSONALIZATION]
Love your work with <PERSONALIZATION>. I'm reaching out because we built a tool that we think help you land more clients.

[PROBLEM]
Tools like PsychologyToday or BetterHelp have thousands of identical looking profiles, making it hard for people to find you. Three out of four therapy seekers find the process overwhelming. On average, they might see up to three therapists before finding the right fit.

[WHAT IS IT]
Matchya works by using natural language to match users to therapists. No intake forms, calling reception, or browsing profiles.

[WHAT WE VALUE]

At Matchya, we believe that by making it easy for people to find a therapist with their unique preferences, they’ll get the help they need.

[SOCIAL PROOF (track record, testimonials, etc)]
We've demo'd to over 50 interested therapy-seekers and are actively growing the users on the platform.

[CTA]
We're offering a 3 month trial to see if it helps grow your practice – no credit cards or commitment necessary.

[WOW]
I made you a profile here, if you’re interested, I’d love to schedule a call with you.
