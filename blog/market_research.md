How do you make money? How much could you make?

(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate)
We’ll generate revenue through $15/month subscriptions for therapists (on par with other directory sites), expanding to physicians, physiotherapists, and dietitians in the future. Additional revenue will come from premium add-on features like client booking/onboarding and discovery call booking. Providers can also pay for higher discoverability through tiered plans or ad space to rank higher in search results.

Based on industry benchmarks—Psychology Today at ~$534.5M ARR and BetterHelp at ~$525.8M ARR—we estimate that by focusing on therapy alone, we could reach $100M in ARR within 6 years. This projection assumes a steady market penetration in key geographies (initially Canada and the U.S.) and efficient customer acquisition, with early unit economics targeting a CAC below $500 and an LTV above $2,000 per provider.

To drive further growth, we plan to 5X these revenues to $1B ARR by:

We'll expand our offering to include other video-based healthcare providers such as physicians, physiotherapists, and dietitian markets with similarly high demand for streamlined booking and client management.

Enabling providers to offer global support, which opens up larger markets and leverages economies of scale.
