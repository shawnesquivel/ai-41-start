# Questionnaire Mapping Guide

This document outlines how responses from the chatbot questionnaire (in `useChatbot.js`) are interpreted and then mapped into structured filters for a therapist similarity search using Pinecone. The filter mappings reference the metadata conventions (detailed in [pinecone_metadata.md](./pinecone_metadata.md)) and the therapy styles/approaches listed in [therapy_styles.md](./therapy_styles.md).

The mappings below serve as a guide for building filter queriesâ€”for example, converting a user's preference into a query filter that includes relevant therapy styles, session durations, or techniques. This document is intended to be the foundation for future modules such as `preference_mapper.py`.

> **Balanced Approach:**  
> Because our therapist directory includes many therapy types, we strive to use a balanced approach by:
>
> - Using the `$in` operator to match a range of related labels rather than an exact string.
>   Example: `{ "approaches": { "$in": ["CBT", "Mindfulness", "Existential"] } }` will match therapists who specialize in CBT, Mindfulness, or Existential therapy if at least one of the labels is present in the therapist's metadata
> - Being cautious not to overconstrain the search (which may exclude good matches).
> - Falling back to a less restrictive query if no therapists match the full filters.

## Overview of Structured Preferences

The questionnaire collects data into the following structured keys:

- **reason**: Main reason for seeking therapy -> filter
- **frequency**: Desired frequency or duration of therapy
- **preferred_therapy**: Preferred therapy style or approach -> narrows the therapists who specialize in that type.
- **session_type**: Preferred setting (e.g., one-on-one, group, remote, in-person) -> does not affect similarity search
- **insurance**: Whether the client has insurance coverage -> does not affect similarity search
- **insurance_provider**: Specific insurance provider (if applicable) -> does not affect similarity search
- **additional_preferences**: Any extra details the client wishes to share (freeform) -> used in the query for similarity search, LLM can also extract metdata filters

## Detailed Question-by-Question Mapping

Each question includes:

- **Answer Options & Reasoning:** Why the answer was chosen, and what therapy approaches it implies.
- **Suggested Filter Mapping:** How to translate the answer into a metadata filter. (Filters use operators such as `$eq` for exact matches or `$in` to include multiple related values.)

      ```

---

### Question 4: Insurance Coverage (does not affect similarity search)

- **Question Text:**
  _"let's talk about insurance coverage. do you have extended health benefits?"_

- **Mapped Preference Key:** `insurance`

- **Answer Options:**

  - **has_insurance**
    **Answer Text:** "yes, i have insurance coverage"
    **Reasoning:**
    Indicates access to a broader network.
    - **Suggested Filter Mapping:**
      ```json
      { "insurance": { "$eq": true } }
      ```
  - **no_insurance**
    **Answer Text:** "no insurance coverage"
    **Reasoning:**
    Points toward out-of-pocket therapy options.

### Question 5: Insurance Provider (does not affect similarity search)

- **Question Text:**

- **Reasoning:**
  These selections directly capture the provider and can later be used to filter for in-network therapists.

- **Suggested Filter Mapping:**
  ```json
  { "insurance_provider": { "$eq": "<provider_value>" } }
  ```

Replace `<provider_value>` with the corresponding answer.

---

### Question 6: Additional Preferences (used for semantic search and specialty filtering)

- **Question Text:**  
  _"lastly ~ do you have any other preferences you'd like to share? some users share experience with specific issues, preferences for gender/ethnicity/sexuality, language(s), faith. you can enter it in the chat below."_

- **Mapped Preference Key:** `additional_preferences`

- **Answer Type:** Freeform chat input

- **Reasoning:**  
  This input can be used to match against specialties from various categories in `therapy_styles.md`:

  - Identity & Cultural Issues (e.g., "Men's issues", "Women's issues", "Racial & cultural identity")
  - Sexuality & Gender Identity (e.g., "LGBTIQA+ issues", "Sexual Orientation")
  - Physical Health & Body
  - Trauma & Recovery
  - Clinical Mental Health
  - Alternative & Holistic approaches

- **Suggested Processing:**
  The freeform text should be analyzed to extract relevant specialties and create additional filters based on the comprehensive specialties list in `therapy_styles.md`.

---

## Summary & Considerations for a Balanced Filtering Approach

- **Structured Filters (Questions 0-5):**
  The mappings above convert key questionnaire responses into filter criteria for a therapist similarity search. Because there are many therapy styles (see [therapy_styles.md](./therapy_styles.md)), using the `$in` operator helps capture a broad yet relevant range.

- **Avoiding Overconstraining:**
  Filtering on too many specific metadata fields (or by requiring exact matches) may overly narrow your results. For instance, if a user selects "growth" and you only filter on `["Integrative", "Humanistic", "Existential"]`, you might miss therapists who label their style slightly differently. A balanced `$in` query helps mitigate this risk.

- **Fallback Strategy:**
  As implemented in the similarity search function, if no matches are found with the full set of filters, the system falls back to a query without filters. This ensures that users still receive recommendations even if the filter is too narrow.

- **Reference Metadata Conventions:**
  For more details on how filters are applied, see [pinecone_metadata.md](./pinecone_metadata.md).

This updated guide should serve as a solid foundation for mapping user questionnaire inputs to meaningful filter criteria while keeping the therapist matching both precise and flexible.

## Example 1

For example, if a user is interested in growth, we will recommend therapists who are skilled in growth-oriented therapies such as

- CBT because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by changing their thoughts and behaviors.
- mindfulness because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by being present and aware of their thoughts and emotions.
- existential therapy because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by finding meaning and purpose in their lives.

## Example 2

Another example is if a user is interested in therapy for stress, we will recommend therapists who are skilled in stress-reduction techniques such as

- CBT because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by changing their thoughts and behaviors.
- mindfulness because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by being present and aware of their thoughts and emotions.
- existential therapy because it is a technique that helps people manage their stress by finding meaning and purpose in their lives.
